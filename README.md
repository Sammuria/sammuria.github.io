# Creating a Force graph in 3D, VR and AR

## Languages and Technology Used:
Languages - JavaScript, HTML and CSS 

Libraries - React, AFrame for AR, D3JS and ThreeJS.


## Changes compared to the previous version:
The previous version developed was a much simple force graph created with Javascript, D3.JS, HTML and CSS on Codepen.io. But was limited to 2D view. https://codepen.io/sammuria/pen/GRqdvYR

The current version is very similar to the sample provided, wherein the code was complex but easy to execute and customize as per the requirement. 

The program generates a 3D force graph with N number of nodes. Here N value is assigned as 10. The node colors and strength were kept constant. 
With the availability of a dataset a funtional 3D graph can be created. 


## Crashes:
VR version with N=300 crashes frequently. This could also be due to the system issue 


## Note:
For the AR testing, the marker image named 'HIRO Marker Image'  is used.
